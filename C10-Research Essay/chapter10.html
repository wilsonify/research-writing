font-weight: bold; line-height: 14pt;">A “Research Essay” or a “Research Project” instead of a “Research Paper”</div><div class="paragraph Normal_1" style="line-height: 16pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; font-family: 'Palatino-Roman', 'Palatino', 'serif'; line-height: 16pt;  text-decoration: none;"> </div><div class="paragraph Normal_1" style="line-height: 16pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; font-family: 'Palatino-Roman', 'Palatino', 'serif'; line-height: 16pt;">Throughout this book, I’ve purposefully avoided the term “research paper” for three reasons.  First, while teachers assign and students write essays in college classes that are commonly called “research papers,” there is no clear consensus on the definition of a research paper.  This is because the definition of “research” differs from field to field, and even between instructors within the same discipline teaching the same course. </div><div class="paragraph Normal_1" style="line-height: 16pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; font-family: 'Palatino-Roman', 'Palatino', 'serif'; line-height: 16pt;  text-decoration: none;"> </div><div class="paragraph Normal_1" style="line-height: 16pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; font-family: 'Palatino-Roman', 'Palatino', 'serif'; line-height: 16pt;">Second, while the papers we tend to call “research papers” do indeed include research, most other kinds of college writing require at least some research as well.  All of the exercises outlined in Part Two of the book, ”  Exercises in the Process of Research” are examples of this:  while none of these assignments are “research papers,” all of them involve research in order to make a point.  </div><div class="paragraph Normal_1" style="line-height: 16pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; font-family: 'Palatino-Roman', 'Palatino', 'serif'; line-height: 16pt;  text-decoration: none;"> </div><div class="paragraph Normal_1" style="line-height: 16pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; font-family: 'Palatino-Roman', 'Palatino', 'serif'; line-height: 16pt;">A third reason has to do with the connotations of the word “paper” versus the word “essay.” For me, “paper” suggests something static, concrete, routine, and uninteresting—think of the negative connotations of the term bureaucratic “paperwork,” or the policing mechanism of “showing your papers” to the authorities.  On the other hand, the word “essay” has more positive connotations:  dynamic, flexible, unique, and creative.  The definitions of essay in dictionaries I have examined include terms like “attempt,” “endeavor,” and “a try.”   As a writer, I would much rather work on something that was a dynamic and creative endeavor rather than a static and routine document.  My hope is that you, as a student and a writer, feel the same way.</div><div class="paragraph Normal_1" style="line-height: 16pt;

margin-top: 0pt; font-family: 'Palatino-Roman', 'Palatino', 'serif'; line-height: 16pt;">But before diving into writing a research essay, you need to take a moment to ask yourself, your colleagues, and your teacher some important questions about the nature of your project. </div><div class="paragraph Normal_1" style="line-height: 16pt;

margin-top: 0pt; font-family: 'Palatino-Roman', 'Palatino', 'serif'; line-height: 16pt;">It is crucial to consider the teacher’s directions and assignment for your research essay.  The teacher’s specific directions will in large part determine what you are required to do to successfully complete your essay, just as they did with the exercises you completed in part two of this book. </div><div class="paragraph Normal_1" style="line-height: 16pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; font-family: 'Palatino-Roman', 'Palatino', 'serif'; line-height: 16pt;  text-decoration: none;"> </div><div class="paragraph Normal_1" style="line-height: 16pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; font-family: 'Palatino-Roman', 'Palatino', 'serif'; line-height: 16pt;">If you have been given the option to choose your own research topic, the assignment for the research essay itself might be open-ended.  For example:</div><div class="paragraph Normal_1" style="line-height: 16pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; font-family: 'Palatino-Roman', 'Palatino', 'serif'; line-height: 16pt;  text-decoration: none;"> </div><div class="paragraph Normal_1" style="line-height: 14pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 0pt; font-family: 'ArialMT', 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; line-height: 14pt;">Write a research essay about the working thesis that you have been working on with the previous writing assignments.  Your essay should be about ten pages long, it should include ample evidence to support your point, and it should follow MLA style.</div><div class="paragraph Normal_1" style="line-height: 16pt;

margin-top: 0pt; font-family: 'Palatino-Roman', 'Palatino', 'serif'; line-height: 16pt;">Some research writing assignments are more specific than this, of course.  For example, here is a research writing assignment for a poetry class:</div><div class="paragraph Normal_1" style="line-height: 14pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 0pt; font-family: 'ArialMT', 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; line-height: 14pt;">Write a seven to ten page research essay about one of the poets discussed in the last five chapters of our textbook and his or her poems.  Besides your analysis and interpretation of the poems, be sure to cite scholarly research that supports your points.  You should also include research on the cultural and historic contexts the poet was working within.  Be sure to use MLA documentation style throughout your essay.</div><div class="paragraph Normal_1" style="line-height: 16pt;

margin-top: 0pt; font-family: 'Palatino-Roman', 'Palatino', 'serif'; line-height: 16pt;">Obviously, you probably wouldn’t be able to write a research project about the problems of advertising prescription drugs on television in a History class that focused on the American Revolution.</div><div class="paragraph Normal_1" style="line-height: 16pt;

margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; font-family: 'Palatino-Roman', 'Palatino', 'serif'; line-height: 16pt;">Has the goal of your essay been to answer specific questions based on assigned reading material and your research?  Or has the purpose of your research been more open-ended and abstract, perhaps to learn more about issues and topics to share with a wider audience?  In other words, is your research essay supposed to answer questions that indicate that you have learned about a set and defined subject matter (usually a subject matter which your teacher already more or less understands), or is your essay supposed to discover and discuss an issue that is potentially unknown to your audience, including your teacher.</div><div class="paragraph Normal_1" style="line-height: 16pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; font-family: 'Palatino-Roman', 'Palatino', 'serif'; line-height: 16pt;  text-decoration: none;"> </div><div class="paragraph Normal_1" style="line-height: 16pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; font-family: 'Palatino-Roman', 'Palatino', 'serif'; line-height: 16pt;">The “demonstrating knowledge about a defined subject matter” purpose for research is quite common in academic writing.  For example, a political science professor might ask students to write a research project about the Bill of Rights in order to help her students learn about the Bill of Rights and to demonstrate an understanding of these important amendments to the U.S. Constitution.  But presumably, the professor already knows a fair amount the Bill of Rights, which means she is probably more concerned with finding out if you can demonstrate that you have learned and have formed an opinion about the Bill of Rights based on your research and study. </div><div class="paragraph Normal_1" style="line-height: 16pt;

Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin, and the body needs insulin to process sugars and starches.  It is a serious disease that effects millions of people, many of whom don’t even know they have the disease.

at other times, this is best accomplished with a more detailed section after the introduction and near the beginning of the essay.</div><div class="paragraph Normal_1" style="line-height: 16pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;

perhaps it is because students so involved in their research forget that their readers haven’t been doing the same kind of research.  The result is that sometimes students “cut corners” in terms of helping their audience through their essay.  I think that the best way to avoid these kinds of misunderstandings is for you to always remember that your readers don’t know as much about your specific essay as you do, and part of your job as a writer is to guide your reader through the text.</div><div class="paragraph Normal_1" style="line-height: 16pt;

As Duderstadt said, "Excelling in academics is challenging enough without the additional pressures of participating in highly competitive athletic programs" (Duderstadt 190). So I can see why some athletes might experience trouble fitting all of the studying and coursework into their busy schedules.</div><div class="paragraph Normal_1" style="line-height: 16pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;

it wraps things up.</div><div class="paragraph Normal_1" style="line-height: 16pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; font-family: 'Palatino-Roman', 'Palatino', 'serif'; line-height: 16pt;  text-decoration: none;"> </div><div class="paragraph Normal_1" style="line-height: 16pt;

margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; line-height: 21pt;">Issues involving student athletes with unsatisfactory test scores, extremely low grade point averages, special privileges given to them by the schools, and issues concerning their coaches' influence on them academically, have all been causes of concern with university athletics. The result is a pattern where athletics at the university level are full of corruption surrounding the academic standards and admittance policy that are placed upon some university athletes.  In this essay, I will explain what I see as the source of this corruption and the ways in which academic standards are compromised in the name of winning.</div><div class="paragraph Plain_Text" style="line-height: 21pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; "><span style="line-height: 21pt; ">The problems surrounding corruption in university athletics have been around ever since sports have been considered important in American culture. People have emphasized the importance of sports and the significance of winning for a long time. According to Jerome Cramer in a special report published in </span><span style="line-height: 21pt; text-decoration: underline; ">Phi Delta Kappan,</span><span style="line-height: 21pt; "> "Sports are a powerful experience, and America somehow took this belief of the ennobling nature of sports and transformed it into a quasi-religion" (Cramer K1).  Cramer also says,</span></div><div class="paragraph Plain_Text" style="line-height: 21pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 0pt; line-height: 21pt;">"The original sin of sports in United States society seems to have been committed when we allowed our games to assume too much of our lives. It was as if we could measure our moral fiber by the won/lost record of our local team. Once schools began to organize sports, winning became a serious institutional consideration. Our innocence vanished when we refused to accept losing" (Cramer K1).</div><div class="paragraph Plain_Text" style="line-height: 21pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; line-height: 21pt;">This importance of sports and winning in the United States today is what has led to this corruption that we now see in our top universities when it comes to athletes and how they are treated by their schools.</div><div class="paragraph Plain_Text" style="line-height: 21pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; line-height: 21pt;">The desire to always have a winning team has driven many universities to admit academically unqualified student athletes to their school just to improve their sports teams. According to James Duderstadt, former president of the University of Michigan, the corruption of university athletics usually begins with the process of recruiting and admitting student athletes. He states that, "At many universities, the tradition of athletic success requires coaches to produce not only competitive but championship-winning teams" (Duderstadt 191). This, in turn, "puts enormous pressure to recruit the most outstanding high school athletes each year, since this has become the key determinant of competitive success in major college sports"(Duderstadt 192).</div><div class="paragraph Plain_Text" style="line-height: 21pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; line-height: 21pt;">According to Duderstadt, "Coaches and admissions officers have long known that the pool of students who excel at academics and athletics is simply too small to fill their rosters with players who meet the usual admissions criteria" (Duderstadt 193). This pressure put on coaches to recruit the best athletes "leads them to recruit athletes who are clearly unprepared for college work or who have little interest in a college education" (Duderstadt 193). This obviously leads to a problem because although most universities have standards that must be met for students to be admitted, "in all too many cases, recruited athletes fail to meet even these minimum standards" (Duderstadt 193).</div><div class="paragraph Plain_Text" style="line-height: 21pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; line-height: 21pt;">The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) set some minimum standards for admission in January of 1986. They had decided that "the time had come to make sure that college athletes were not only athletically qualified, but that they also were academically competent to represent schools of higher learning" (Cramer K4). Proposition 48 required that "all entering athletes score a minimum of 700 on their Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) and achieve a minimum high school grade point average in core academic courses of 2.0, or sit out their first year" (Duderstadt 194). This seemed like a fairly reasonable rule to most universities around the country, and some even thought, "a kid who can not score a combined 700 and keep a C average in high school should not be in college in the first place" (Cramer K4).  </div><div class="paragraph Plain_Text" style="line-height: 21pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; "><span style="line-height: 21pt; ">In 1992, the NCAA changed these requirements slightly with the introduction of proposition 16.  According to the document “Who Can Play? An Examination of NCAA’s Proposition 16,” which was published on the National Center for Educational Statistics in August 1995, Proposition 16 requirements are “</span><span style="color: #000000; line-height: 21pt; opacity: 1.00; ">more strict than the current Proposition 48 requirements. The new criteria are based on a combination of high school grade point average (GPA) in 13 core courses and specified SAT (or ACT) scores.”</span></div><div class="paragraph Plain_Text" style="line-height: 21pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000; line-height: 21pt; opacity: 1.00;">Some coaches and college athletes have argued against proposition 48 and proposition 16 because they claim that they unfairly discriminate against African-American students.  According to Robert Fullinwider’s web-based article “Academic Standards and the NCAA,” some “black coaches were so incensed that they toyed with the idea of boycotting NCAA events.”  Fullinwider goes on:</div><div class="paragraph Plain_Text" style="line-height: 21pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 0pt; color: #000000; line-height: 21pt; opacity: 1.00;">John Thompson, then-coach of Georgetown University’s basketball team, complained that poor minority kids were at a disadvantage taking the "mainstream-oriented" SAT. "Certain kids," he noted just after the federal court’s decision, "require individual assessment. Some urban schools cater to poor kids, low-income kids, black and white. To put everybody on the same playing field [i.e., to treat them the same in testing] is just crazy."</div><div class="paragraph Plain_Text" style="line-height: 21pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; "><span style="line-height: 21pt; ">Fullinwider writes that the legality of Proposition 16 was challenged in March 1999 on the basis that it was discriminatory to African-American student athletes.  However, in its summary of the case </span><span style="color: #000000; line-height: 21pt; opacity: 1.00; ">Cureton v. NCAA, the Marquette University Law School </span><span style="color: #000000; line-height: 21pt; opacity: 1.00; text-decoration: underline; ">You Make the Call</span><span style="color: #000000; line-height: 21pt; opacity: 1.00; "> web site explains that the federal courts ultimately decided that Proposition 16 was not a violation of students’ civil rights and could be enforced by the NCAA.</span></div><div class="paragraph Plain_Text" style="line-height: 21pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; line-height: 21pt;">With rules like Proposition 48 and Proposition 16, "the old practice of recruiting athletes who are clearly unqualified for admission with the hope that their contributions on the field will be sufficient before their inadequacy in the classroom, slowed somewhat" (Duderstadt 195). However, as facts show today, it seems as if these rules are harder to enforce in some universities than the NCAA originally thought.</div><div class="paragraph Plain_Text" style="line-height: 21pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; line-height: 21pt;">There have been many documented instances of athletes being admitted to a university without even coming close to meeting the minimum requirements for academic eligibility set by the NCAA. One such instance happened just one year after Proposition 48 was enacted. North Carolina State University signed Chris Washburn, "one of the most highly recruited high school seniors in the nation" (Cramer K4). Although Washburn proved to be valuable to the team, it was later found out that "his combined score on the SAT was a whopping 470," and that he had "an abysmal academic record in high school" (Cramer K4). Both his SAT score and his poor grades in high school all fell much lower than the standards set by the NCAA.</div><div class="paragraph Plain_Text" style="line-height: 21pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; line-height: 21pt;">According to Art Padilla, former vice president for academic affairs at the University of North Carolina System, student athletes like Chris Washburn are not uncommon at most universities (Cramer K5). He states, "Every major college sports institution has kids with that kind of academic record, and if they deny it, they are lying" (Cramer K5).</div><div class="paragraph Plain_Text" style="line-height: 21pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; line-height: 21pt;">The admitting of unqualified students is not the only place where colleges seem to step out of bounds though. Once the athlete has been admitted and signed with the university, for some, a long list of corruption from the university is still to follow when it comes to dealing with their academics.</div><div class="paragraph Plain_Text" style="line-height: 21pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; line-height: 21pt;">Furthermore, many universities face a lot of pressure to recruit good players to their schools regardless of their academic skills. Debra Blum reported in 1996 about the case of a star basketball player who wanted to attend Vanderbilt University.  As Blum writes, “Vanderbilt denied him (basketball player Ron Mercer) admission, describing his academic record as not up to snuff.  So he enrolled at Kentucky, where he helped his team to a national championship last season” (A51).  The case of Vanderbilt losing Mercer caused a lot of “soul searching” at Vanderbilt, in part because there was a lot of pressure from “other university constituents, particularly many alumni ... to do what it takes to field more-competitive teams, especially in football and men’s basketball” (A51).</div><div class="paragraph Plain_Text" style="line-height: 21pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; line-height: 21pt;">But these pressures are also the point where school officials are tempted to break the rules. As John Gerdy wrote in his article "A Suggestion For College Coaches: Teach By Example,” in universities where the purpose of recruiting a great athlete is to improve the team, they often claim, "intercollegiate athletics are about education, but it is obvious that they are increasingly about entertainment, money, and winning" (28). </div><div class="paragraph Plain_Text" style="line-height: 21pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; line-height: 21pt;">Mixed messages are sent when some student-athletes "are referred to as "players" and "athletes" rather than "students" and "student-athletes" (Gerdy 28). It is clear that these student-athletes are sometimes only wanted for their athletic ability, and it is also clear that there are sometimes many pressures to recruit such students. As Austin C. Wherwein said, many student athletes "are given little incentive to be scholars and few persons care how the student athlete performs academically, including some of the athletes themselves" (Quoted in Thelin 183).  </div><div class="paragraph Plain_Text" style="line-height: 21pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; "><span style="line-height: 21pt; ">In some cases, coaches directly encourage students to emphasize their athletic career instead of their studies.  One such instance, reported in </span><span style="line-height: 21pt; text-decoration: underline; ">Sports Illustrated</span><span style="line-height: 21pt; "> by Austin Murphy, involves an Ohio State tailback, Robert Smith, who quit the football team "saying that coaches had told him he was spending too much time on academics" (Murphy 9). Smith claims that offensive coordinator Elliot Uzelac "encouraged him to skip a summer-school chemistry class because it was causing Smith, who was a pre-med student, to miss football practice" (Murphy 9). Smith did not think this was right so he walked off the team (Murphy 9). Supposedly, "the university expressed support for Uzelac, who denied Smith's allegations" (Murphy 9). </span></div><div class="paragraph Plain_Text" style="line-height: 21pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; line-height: 21pt;">Another way some universities sometimes manage the academic success of their student-athletes is to enroll them in easier classes, particularly those set up specifically for student-athletes. The curriculum for some of these courses is said to be "less than intellectually demanding"(Cramer K2). Jan Kemp, a remedial English professor at the University of Georgia who taught a class with just football players for students, was "troubled by the fact that many of her students seemed incapable of graduating from college" (Cramer K2). This seems surprising, but in fact some athletes from the University of Georgia "were described as being given more than four chances to pass developmental studies classes" without ever being successful (Cramer K2). Also, "school records show that in an effort to keep athletes playing, several were placed in the regular academic curriculum without having passed even the watered-down classes" (Cramer K2). Although this particular story comes from the University of Georgia, it is not just unique to that school. Many universities have been guilty of doing such things for their athletes just so they could continue to play on the team.</div><div class="paragraph Plain_Text" style="line-height: 21pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; "><span style="line-height: 21pt; ">Of course, not all student-athletes are bad students. Many student-athletes actually do well in school and excel both athletically and academically. But although these true "student-athletes" do exist, they are often overshadowed by those negative images of athletes who do not do as well in school. And while all sorts of different sports have had academic problems with their athletes, the majority of corruption at the university level exists in football and basketball teams (Cramer K3). According to Duderstadt, "football and basketball are not holding their own when it comes to student academic honors" (Duderstadt 190). He says "Football and basketball have developed cultures with low expectations for academic performance. For many student-athletes in these sports, athletics are clearly regarded as a higher priority than their academic goals" (Duderstadt 191). So although this label of the bad student-athlete does not even come close to applying to all athletes, some universities are still considered, as John Thelin wrote in his book </span><span style="line-height: 21pt; text-decoration: underline; ">Games Colleges Play</span><span style="line-height: 21pt; ">, "academically corrupt and athletically sound" (199).</span></div><div class="paragraph Plain_Text" style="line-height: 21pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; line-height: 21pt;">As James Moore and Sherry Watt say in their essay “Who Are Student Athletes?”, the “marriage between higher education and intercollegiate athletics has been turbulent, and always will be" (7).  The NCAA has tried to make scholarly success at least as important as athletic success with requirements like Proposition 48 and Proposition 16.  But there are still too many cases where under-prepared students are admitted to college because they can play a sport, and there are too still too many instances where universities let their athletes get away with being poor students because they are a sport superstar.  I like cheering for my college team as much as anyone else, but I would rather cheer for college players who were students who worried about learning and success in the classroom, too.</div><div class="paragraph Plain_Text" style="line-height: 21pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; line-height: 21pt;  text-decoration: none;"> </div><div class="paragraph Plain_Text" style="line-height: 21pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; line-height: 21pt;  text-decoration: none;"> </div><div class="paragraph Free_Form" style="line-height: 11pt; margin-top: 3.5pt; "></div><div class="paragraph Plain_Text" style="line-height: 21pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: -3.5pt; line-height: 21pt;">Works Cited</div><div class="paragraph Plain_Text" style="line-height: 21pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; line-height: 21pt;  text-decoration: none;"> </div><div class="paragraph Plain_Text" style="line-height: 21pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: -36pt; "><span style="line-height: 21pt; ">Blum, Debra E.
